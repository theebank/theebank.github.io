My name is Theeban Kumaresan and I'm a MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering candidate at the University of Toronto! I recently completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Ottawa and since then, I've been working towards my MEng as well as pursuing some of my hobbies such as travelling and rock climbing!

I'm excited to showcase my projects, past experiences and skills in this website. Here, you'll find a collection of my favourite projects that demonstrate my technical abilities, problem-solving skills and passion for the field.
